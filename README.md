Small program to test terrain generation for a future project.
It creates an icosahedron and then subdivides it to a specified iteration.
Once the height algorithm is applied, the vertices will be the mesh from which the surface of the planet is generated.
It outputs a wavefront .OBJ that can be used in any 3D model program.
